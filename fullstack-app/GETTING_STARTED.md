## üöÄ Quick Start (Docker)

From this directory:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**That's it!** Now visit:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:4000

## üõë To Stop

```bash
docker-compose down
```

```

### Delete Product
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/products/1
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development (Without Docker)

### Terminal 1 - Backend

```bash
cd nestjs-backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

Backend runs on: http://localhost:4000

### Terminal 2 - Frontend

```bash
cd nextjs-chakra-app
npm install
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000" > .env.local
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000

## üìä Pre-loaded Products

The backend comes with 5 sample products:

1. **Laptop Pro 15** - $1,299.99 (Electronics)
2. **Wireless Mouse** - $29.99 (Accessories)
3. **USB-C Hub** - $49.99 (Accessories)
4. **Mechanical Keyboard** - $89.99 (Peripherals)
5. **27" 4K Monitor** - $399.99 (Electronics)

## üé® UI Features

### Stock Status Badges
- **Green (In Stock)**: Stock > 20
- **Yellow (Low Stock)**: Stock 1-20
- **Red (Out of Stock)**: Stock = 0

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full table view
- Tablet: Optimized layout
- Mobile: Stacked cards

### Form Validation
- Required fields marked with *
- Real-time validation
- Error messages
- Success notifications

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If ports 3000 or 4000 are busy, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    ports:
      - "4001:4000"  # Change to 4001
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"  # Change to 3001
```

### Cannot Connect to Backend

1. Check backend is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   
2. Check backend health:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/health
   ```

3. Check logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   ```

### Frontend Shows Error

Check if backend is accessible:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/products
```

View frontend logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs frontend
```

### Need to Rebuild

After code changes:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

## üí° Tips

- Use **Ctrl+C** in terminal to stop Docker Compose
- Use `docker-compose logs -f` to follow logs in real-time
- Backend data is in-memory, so it resets on restart
- Frontend connects to backend via Docker network internally
- All TypeScript for type safety
